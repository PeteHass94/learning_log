        <h2>Week 4: Conditional Statements, Form Validation, Online Quiz, Image Swaps and Banners</h2>
        <p>Developing my understanding of JavaScript further</p>
        <h4>Practical 6: Conditional Statements <a href="./practical_7/_Practical 6.pdf" target="_blank">here</a></h4>
        <p>Conditional statements help the user feel more involved with the website. The user gets feedback when using and acting with the website is often make the experience better.</p>
        <p>Statements could have been expanded on but I feel I developed a good understanding in this practical.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The console.log() js command was useful to check and see results</li>
          <li>The alert messages were easily coded and provided instant feedback.</li>

        <h4>Practical 7: Nested Looping and Validation <a href="./practical_8/_Practica 7.pdf" target="_blank">here</a></h4>
        <p>The part to be to search for 9 was difficult to answer accurately, i used a work around by changing the code slightly, to make it searchible feature. If the code was to use a nested statement I commented that out my suggestion for it.</p>
        <p>The Alernative method not requiring a search function:</p>
        <pre>
          <code>
            for (j=1; j<=3; j++) {
             window.document.write('&lttr&gt');
            for (i=1; i<=5; i++) {
              //an alternative to the 2nd script
              if (9 == +i * +j){
                window.document.write('&lttd align="right" style="background: yellow;"&gt',i*j,'&lt/td&gt');
              }
              else
              window.document.write('&lttd align="right" id="',i*j,'"&gt',i*j,'&lt/td&gt');
             }
             document.write("&lt/tr&gt\n");
            }
          </code>
        </pre>
        <ul>
          <li>The console.log() js command was useful to check and see results</li>
          <li>Forms were created without a "submit" type button as submit often refreshed the page.</li>

        <h4>Practical 8: Form Validation <a href="./practical_9/_Practical 8.pdf" target="_blank">here</a></h4>
        <p>Task 1 says survey on user's favourite music then shows a form and provides code about books which was very confusing. I decided to stick with the books to makesure I could use your code provided.</p>
        <p>All tasks are on the index.html file to make it easier to follow.</p>
        <p>The information provided in i didn't state wether to make a name for the eMail but the code later on used it which was a tad misleading.</p>
        <p>A fully valided form was stasifying to complete.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The console.log() js command was useful to check and see results</li>
          <li>Also using googles dev tools using their inspect function on chrome prooved to be very useful in completing this practical.</li>

        <h4>Practical 9: Online Quiz <a href="./practical_10/_Practical 9.pdf" target="_blank">here</a></h4>
        <p>Online quiz was enjoyable learning the answers to XHTML</p>
        <p>coding symbols &lt and &gt was strange at first but makes sense on display.</p>
        <p>The indexing for selecting values is a more efficent way to extract the information than what I learned previously.</p>

        <p>The joys of expressing what I learned was evident here. Using Pictures of Arsenal</p>
        <p>I used addEventListener using the key names from javascript intro presentation.</p>
